<ExpansionPanel title="Swift Package Manager Installation">

**NOTE**: These instructions are intended for usage on Xcode 11 and higher. Xcode 11 is the first version of Xcode that integrates Swift Package manager and makes it _way_ easier to use than it was at the command line. If you are using older versions of Xcode, we recommend using CocoaPods.

Select what version you want to use, then hit next. Xcode will automatically suggest the current version `Up to Next Major`, we **strongly** suggest that while the iOS SDK is on a `0.x.x` version scheme, you select `Up To Next Minor` instead, as we will still be releasing breaking changes on minor versions:

Select which packages you want to use. If you're just getting started, try selecting just the main `Apollo` library first - you can always come back and add the other packages later if you need them. Then hit finish.
