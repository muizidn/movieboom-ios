<h4>Install CocoaPods</h4>

Because Apollo iOS has been written using Swift 5, you need to use version `1.7.0` or higher. You can install CocoaPods using:

 ```sh
 gem install cocoapods
 ```

<ExpansionPanelListItem number="2">

<h4>Add dependencies</h4>

Add `pod "Apollo"` to your Podfile.

  - If you also want to use the `ApolloSQLite` framework, also add `pod "Apollo/SQLite"`
  - If you also want to use the `ApolloWebSocket` framework, also add `pod "Apollo/WebSocket"`

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem number="3">

Run `pod install`.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem number="4">

Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project.
